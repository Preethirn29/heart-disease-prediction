## 📝 Description
This project focuses on building an intelligent system to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. Users can input their symptoms via a Streamlit web interface, and the model will determine the likelihood of heart disease. To enhance accessibility and explainability, the system integrates a local LLM assistant that answers health-related questions.
## ❗Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Timely detection is critical, yet access to diagnostic tools is limited in many areas. This project aims to provide:  
• An accurate heart disease prediction model  
• A user-friendly interface for non-technical users  
• AI-driven explanations for better health awareness
